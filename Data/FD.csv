Maintenance and care: In late winter or early spring  plant the tubers 1"" deep in flats of peat and sand. Keep the soil moist but not soggy  and at a temperature of at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When roots appear  pot the tubers individually. Maintain them in a warm  moderately lit place until all danger of frost has passed. After frost danger has passed  the plants may be moved outside to beds or planters. In excess shade  the plants will lose their color; in excess heat  they will burn. In early fall  before frost danger begins  gently remove the tubers from the beds  or bring the pots indoors. With the soil around the roots intact  place the tubers in a warm (60 degrees Fahrenheit) well-ventilated place until the spring.

Foliage texture: medium Shape: cushion  mound or clump upright Shape in flower: flower stalks with upright spikes flower stalks with flowers with petal radiating outward Solitary  daisy-like blooms borne on erect stems rising above the foliage.,Special characteristics: deer resistant non-aggressive non-invasive native to North America - Central and southern U.S. Attracts: butterflies Special uses: cut flowers wildflowers naturalistic garden,How to plant: Propagate by seed  cuttings  division or separation - Divide every 2 to 3 years in early spring to promote cold hardiness and maintain plant vigor. Undivided plants are not long-lived.Sow seeds indoors in late winter  or outdoors in seedbed in midspring. Move to garden when frost danger has passed. Make cuttings in spring. Maintenance and care: Plants are short-lived  but don't flower themselves to death as fast as large-flowered tickseed (C. grandiflora). To maintain hardiness and vigor  divide every 2 to 3 years. Deadhead daily to prolong blooming. Cut plants back in midsummer if their growth becomes straggly. This prevents excessive flowering  which can kill the plant. Cut plants back nearly to the ground in late summer or early fall to encourage healthy new foliar growth. Allow foliage to remain for the winter  then clean up the plants in the spring.

But seeds collected from plants will not breed true and will require two or more years of growth before flowering. Maintenance and care: Deadhead to prolong flowering  prevent self seeding and focus attention on peaking flowers. If desired  leave fall blooms on the plant to form seedheads for winter interest. This will attract birds  but also results in prodigeous self-seeding.To encouraged delayed blooming for fall enjoyment  cut plants back by half in early summer or cut back by 1 foot when coming into bloom. For maximum bloom period  cut back some plants in the garden as described  and leave others to flower at their normal earlier time.Seldom needs division. Roots don't like to be disturbed.

Hang bunches in a well-ventilated area to dry.,"How to plant: Propagate by seed  cuttings  layering  division or separation - Lavender is most easily propagated by cuttings or division. Named varieties of lavender should be propagated by cuttings or layering and not by seed which will most likely not come true. May self-seed if not deadheaded.Cuttings of strong growth taken with a heel in July or August can be grown in a greenhouse or cold frame the first winter and planting out the next spring after frost danger.Seeds germinate slowly. Barely cover seeds with soil in a greenhouse. They will germinate in 1 to 3 months. When large enough to handle  put seedlings in individual pots and grow in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter  planting them out late the next spring after the last expected frost.Layering is possible at any time of the year by scraping the bark near the base of a long stem  applying a rooting hormone and bending the stem down and pegging with a ""V"" cut from a coat hanger. Maintenance and care: Deadheading after first bloom may encourage plants to rebloom. This is also a good time to shape plants. But avoid pruning after late summer until new growth begins the following spring. Cut back heavily (to about 6 inches) every 2 or 3 years to keep plants from getting straggly.Compared with other shrubs  lavender is not a long-lived plant  so it is best to replace old plants about every ten years.For low hedges there are many dwarf and semi-dwarf cultivars to choose from that respond well to trimming.

Seeds are slow to germinate but can be sown inside. The seedlings should be potted and held inside for the first winter and then planted out the next spring or early summer.Take 3- to 4-inch  half-ripe stem-tip cuttings in summer. They can be planted out directly in the garden in July or August and should be well-rooted by winter.Divide plants in spring or fall. Large divisions can be planted out directly but smaller divisions are best grown in a cold frame for their first winter. Maintenance and care: Plants are very tolerant of shearing at the proper time. If grown in less exposed areas they can be lightly trimmed in the fall  otherwise they must be cut back in early spring. If cut back too late in the spring plants will not flower that season. But some don't care for the flowers and trim plants through summer to maintain a well-groomed appearance.To prevent plants from getting leggy  trim back to 6 inches every 2 or 3 years.Do not prune hard in late summer or fall as plants need time to harden off for winter.Mulch to protect plants overwinter.Lavender cotton can be grown as a ground cover and makes a good companion plant for roses.
